# Dana Teagle - Juno WD Bootcamp 44 - Project 1

## About

Under the Sea is a PSD conversion project completed by by Dana Teagle in September 2022 at [Juno College](https://junocollege.com) as part of the Web Development Bootcamp (Cohort 44). This site was written using HTML, SCSS, and Javscript.

## Design and Process

The assignmed design was the website for an aquarium called Under the Sea, and it features three pages (Home, Blog, Contact), with room for more. The design uses many overlapping images and box-shadow effects in a blue, green, white, and black colour scheme.

Only the desktop design was supplied, but for this project I chose to start with a mobile-first responsive layout, featuring breakpoints when enlarged from mobile to tablet, and then again to desktop.

My completed project features a working Javascript hamburger menu, hover and focus effects, as well as the responsive and accessible layout specified, using semantic HTML where possible, as well as using SASS to separate and structure my CSS out into partials.

This project was great practice in using many of the HTML and CSS best practices I've learned during this first stage of the Bootcamp.
